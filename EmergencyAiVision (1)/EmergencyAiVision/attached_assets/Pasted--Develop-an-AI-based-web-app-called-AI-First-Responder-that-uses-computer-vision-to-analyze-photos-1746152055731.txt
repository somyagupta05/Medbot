"Develop an AI-based web app called 'AI First Responder' that uses computer vision to analyze photos of injuries or conditions, provides real-time first aid guidance with a severity score, and suggests nearby hospitals for severe cases. The app should feature multilingual support, a chatbot assistant, and location-based services."

APIs Needed:
1. Computer Vision
API for Injury Detection:

Custom ML Model: Train your model on TensorFlow or PyTorch, deploy using TensorFlow Serving or Flask/FastAPI, and expose via a REST API.

Alternative: Use Google Cloud Vision AI for initial experimentation with custom labels.

2. First Aid Guidance
Instruction Generator:

OpenAI GPT-4 API: Generate text-based first aid instructions using predefined prompts.

Alternative: Custom rule-based logic if you want to reduce dependency.

3. Severity Estimation
Custom Classifier API: Deploy using Flask/FastAPI after training the model.

Alternative: Use Azure Cognitive Services Decision API to augment your logic.

4. Location Services
Google Maps API: For mapping and navigation.

Google Places API: To fetch nearest hospitals based on user location.

OpenCage Geocoder API: For reverse geocoding (if needed).

5. Multilingual Support
Google Cloud Translation API: For translating instructions into different languages.

Alternative: Use Microsoft Translator API.

6. Chatbot Integration
Dialogflow API: Build a conversational assistant to guide users in emergencies.

Alternative: Use Rasa Open Source for custom chatbot development.

Step-by-Step Development Plan:
Backend Development
Build the Computer Vision Model:

Train a CNN (e.g., EfficientNet) on injury datasets.

Deploy the model on Replit using Flask or FastAPI.

Endpoint: /analyze-image (POST) for image classification.

Create Severity Estimator:

Use a lightweight classifier to map detected conditions to severity scores.

Endpoint: /severity-score (POST).

Develop First Aid Generator:

Use GPT-4 API for dynamic instruction generation.

Endpoint: /generate-instructions (POST).

Integrate Location APIs:

Fetch GPS data from the client.

Use Google Places API to get nearby hospitals.

Endpoint: /find-hospital (GET).

Frontend Development
Design UI in React.js/React Native:

Image upload component.

Severity and instructions display.

Map view for hospital recommendations.

Implement Camera & Location Access:

Use react-native-camera or browser APIs for image capture.

Use geolocation APIs for fetching user location.

Multilingual Interface:

Dropdown for language selection.

Translate content using Google Cloud Translation.

Add Chatbot Assistant:

Embed Dialogflow chatbot or Rasa integration for user queries.

Bonus Features for Competitive Edge:
Offline Mode: Preload common first aid instructions.

Wearable Sensors Integration: Simulate using mock data for demos.

Multilingual First Aid Videos: Use WHO/Red Cross resources.
